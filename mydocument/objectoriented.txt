collection is interface 
collections is class which contains algorithem .
list,queue and set interfaces are extended by collection interface.


hashset+set=linkedhashset
hasmap+map=linkedhasmap
deque+list=linkedlist
set+abstract=hashset
list+abstract=Arraylist
map+abstract=hashmap
Abstract++=tree
map+set=hashtable
set:not allow duplicate 
list:allow duplicate
map:key value pair
tree=sorted+no null
linkedhash =insertion order 
hash=no order
arraylist=good for retrieve
linkedlist=good for manipulation
iterator =only forward direction
list-iterator=both direction

1.what is diffrence between iterator and enumerator 
enumerator is only for read only mode and iterator is for adding and removing both

2.what is iterator ?
it is interface and used iterator over collection 

3.vector and arrylist 
vector is synchronised(thread safe and slow and size increase by 100%) and arrylist is not (incresed by 50%)
