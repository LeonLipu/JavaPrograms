1.why string is immutable 
string demo=hello 
string is immutable (can not modified )
demo=king 
still hello in (constant string pool) just lost the reference 
-it thread safe 
2.string buffer : is mutable(heap) and it is  thread safe
-method of string buffer is synchronized and thread safe 
-string buffer can be converted by string by toString() method
-slow due to safe property is implemented .
3.string builder = is mutable (heap ) is not thread safe 
-fast

4.jvm :
classloder =it subsystem in jvm to load class file 
storage : class:store per-class runtime constant pool ,filed and another data.
heap : object is created here and it is runtime data area.
stack :hold local variable and partial result and plays part in method invocation and return result.
programregister :it hold address of next instruction to be executed .
native method stack : all native method used for application .

5: non-access modifier : static ,abstract ,final and synchronized 
static :class variable 
final : variable :can not be reassigned .static and final both used to make constant .   
      :method:can not overrided 
      :class: can not be parent class :no one can inherit property from this class.
     
abstract : class: class can not create instance .
           abstract method : can be declared without implementation .
synchronized : method : only one thread can access at a time .
 transient variable: jvm skip when variable hold by serialized object
